Play at https://poker.peterwu.dev. Note that the site has to cold start because I'm a college student who doesn't want to pay for more dynos on Heroku.

Using `socket.io`, `Node.js`, and `express` to make a distributed poker game. Allows for multiple
gameplay rooms simultaneously across different devices.
